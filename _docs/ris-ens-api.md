Kount allows a great deal of control over fraud management through a variety of methods including the risk score, rules to determine risk thresholds, VIP lists, and many others that are administered through the Agent Web Console. Kount also provides the ability for interaction for some functions without the need of the Agent Web Console by utilizing the Event Notification System (ENS) and the Application Programming Interface (API).

Specification guides for the ENS and API can be requested from your account manager or access the API endpoints list by pointing your browser to https://api.kount.net/rpc/list.html.
