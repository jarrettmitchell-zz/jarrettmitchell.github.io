## Overview
The Data Collector runs on a client’s browser and collects a variety of information that helps uniquely identify the device. Add the `<script>` tag to the web page where you want to trigger the Data Collection. The variables are found in Variable Values table on the Session ID Discussion page. Below is sample code.

## High Level Integration Steps

<ul class="uk-list uk-list-divider">
    <li>1. Update the Content Security Policy to the header of the page.</li>
    <li>2. Add the load event to the class kaxsdc in the BODY (this may be attached to a different html
element).</li>
    <li>3. Add the Script tag with the correct Data Collection URL, Merchant ID and Session value.</li>
    <li>4. Set the ka.ClientSDK to autorun when kaxsdc class loads.</li>
</ul>

## Create the `kaxsdc` Class


The Client Collector SDK data collection process is triggered by the 'load' data-event. This gives the
collector the most available time to complete its work. The collection is bound to the page load event by
adding the kaxsdc class and data-event=‘load’ to an HTML element, such as the HTML body or a div.
(Code example below).

{% include alert.html style="success" text="NOTE: Responsible for triggering data collection."%}


## Namespace & ka.ClientSDK Object

The Kount collector JavaScript is namespaced under the ka JavaScript object. It is required to have the
above /collect/sdk script tag into your page, which will import the Client Collector SDK. To start using
the Client Collector SDK, create a new ClientSDK object: `var client = new ka.ClientSDK()`; (Code example
below).

## Available methods in the ka.ClientSDK object

<ul uk-accordion="multiple: true">
    <li class="uk-closed">
        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">autoLoadEvents()</a>
        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>Attaches the collection process to be automatically triggered by the page
elements load event with the className “kaxsdc.”</p>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="uk-accordion-title" href="#">setupCallback(config) </a>
        <div class="uk-accordion-content">
            <p>(OPTIONAL) A client programmable callback system that allows the client to
execute custom code at certain points in the data collection process. This
method allows a merchant to add a callback function to be called at a
specified life-cycle hook. A merchant can pass a JavaScript object containing
one or more life cycle hooks with a function pointer or an anonymous
function to be executed.</p>
<p>List of hooks. (In order of firing)</p>
            <p>• collect-begin - Triggers when the collection starts.</p>
            <p>• collect-end - Triggers when the collection ends.</p>
<p>When executed, the callback function is passed a JavaScript object containing
the following properties:</p>
            <p>• MercSessId – The merchant provided session.</p>
            <p>• MerchantId – The merchant Id.</p>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

## Code Example

This code collects device information on page load and includes an optional code
example that will fire an alert when the process reaches the collect-begin and collect-end hooks.

{% include alert.html style="success" text="NOTE: It is recommended that the Data Collector code exist at the top of the page load so it has adequate time to run before a user finishes their interaction with the webpage."%}
