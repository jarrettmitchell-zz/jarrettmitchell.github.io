## Overview

Installing the Kount Complete app in your Shopify store is fast and easy, involving a few simple steps. Prior to using Kountâ€™s Agent Web Console (AWC), merchants are required to sign a contract with Kount LLC, and receive a product demonstration delivered remotely by a dedicated account team. Please contact sales@kount.com or 877-538-5538 to be paired with an account executive and schedule a demonstration. After a demonstration, you will work with a Client Success Manager, who will walk you through installation and onboarding. 

Your Client Success Manager will provide the following information, necessary to install and begin using Kount.
* Your Merchant ID
* Login Credentials for the Agent Web Console
