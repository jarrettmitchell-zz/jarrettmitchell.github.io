Kount supports multiple payment types and depending upon the payment type chosen by the customer certain payment tokens are required. If the PayPal Payer ID or Google Checkout Account ID is not sent in the inquiry mode, then it must be sent in the update mode related to the transaction otherwise the order details will not be displayed in the Agent Web Console.

Kount can add arbitrary payment types rapidly to support an international market. To view the current
list of supported payment types, use the API endpoint:
https://api.kount.net/rpc/support/payments.html

See the API Specification Guide for further details. The content of the endpoint is generated in HTML but
changing the extension to .xml or .json will produce content in those formats.
